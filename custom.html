                <p>Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic. This means that they obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water, using the green pigment chlorophyll.</p>

                <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. </p>

        <h3>Nature</h3>
        <p>Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objectsâ€”the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.</p>
